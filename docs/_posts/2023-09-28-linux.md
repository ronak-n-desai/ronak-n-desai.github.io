This is a page with explanations of various linux commands that have made my life easier

## Finding/Searching Files

To search for a particular filename in the current directory and all subdirectories type 

`find . -name "filename"`

## SLURM

To cancel all jobs, type 

`squeue -u $USER | awk '{print $1}' | tail -n+2 | xargs scancel`

If we just want to view one job, we can type `squeue -u $USER` and can cancel that job with `scancel <jobid>`. 

To display more information about a job, can type in `scontrol show job <jobid>`.
