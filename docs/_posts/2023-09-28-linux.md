This is a page with explanations of various linux commands that have made my life easier

## Finding/Searching Files

To search for a particular filename in the current directory and all subdirectories type 

`find . -name "filename"`

## SLURM

- To cancel all jobs, type 

`squeue -u $USER | awk '{print $1}' | tail -n+2 | xargs scancel`

- If we just want to view one job, we can type `squeue -u $USER` and can cancel that job with `scancel <jobid>`. 

- To display more information about a job, can type in `scontrol show job <jobid>`.

- To submit a batch job, we can type in `sbatch Job.sh` where `Job.sh` has all the SLURM directives for submitting a job. Some example directives below:
  + `--ntasks-per-node=48`
  + `--time=1:00:00`
  + `--nodes=1`
  + `--account=PAS1066`
  + `--output=slurm.out`
  + `--constraint=48core`
  + `--cluster=PITZER`
  + `--job-name=test`
  + `--mail-user=desai.458@osu.edu`

- For quickly testing if a program can run, can just use `srun` with the SLURM directives passed in as command line arguments. In this way, the program will run in the terminal. This is more useful for seeing the output pop out in real time and for debugging.
