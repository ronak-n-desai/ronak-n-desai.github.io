## Chapter 1: 4 Resume Principles to Live by for Data Scientists
1. The sole purpose of your resume is to land an interview
   + Keep Concise: Remove fluff
   + Put U.S. Citizen on Resume for Government Jobs
   + Highlight key words
2. Build your resume to impress the recruiter
   + Don't be too technical with words, recruiters aren't experts in your fields
   + Give metrics: numbers, quantify things
3. Only include things that make you look good
  + Avoid neutral information
  + Better to include relevant keywords/skills in context rather than in separate skills section
4. Break formatting and convention to your favor
   + Do what makes the most sense to paint the best story
   + Hyperlink to outside work
   + Name Resume PDFs with good names: include job name in resume
