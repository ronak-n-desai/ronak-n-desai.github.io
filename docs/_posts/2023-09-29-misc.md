# Setting up SSH for Passwordless Authentication
When using VSCode to remote log in to OSC, it kept prompting for my password and never saved it between sessions. To get around this, we need to set up an SSH public/private key pair. 

1. Navigate to `~/.ssh` on your personal computer and type in
   
   ```ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096```
   
   to generate a public/private key pair. The public key is stored in the file with file extension *pub* which is what needs to get transferred to OSC and the private key (does not have a file extension) stays on your personal computer. You can decline to set a passphrase for this key and use the default name it suggests.

3. The next steps depend on if you have MAC/LINUX or WINDOWS on your personal computer.

* If MAC/LINUX: type in

  `ssh-copy-id username@domain`

  For example, my username/domain on OSC would be `ronakndesai@pitzer.osc.edu`.
* If WINDOWS: the copy-id command may not be available, so we will need to manually transfer the public key. Open up the public key file (something like id_rsa.pub) and there should be a lot of text on just one line starting with ssh-rsa. Copy this entire line and paste it into the file called `authorized_keys` in the `~/.ssh` folder on the remote server. If this has never been done before, you may need to manually create a file called `authorized_keys` here.
