title: Manipulating Images and Videos
---

This page is a resource filled with commands and tools to manipulate and create images and videos

# ImageMagick
[Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/) is a useful tool to convert images/videos between different file types. First, install ImageMagick from the website (and it may be necessary to install this [postscript and pdf interpreter](https://www.ghostscript.com/releases/index.html) as well). After this, typing `magick` in the command prompt should not yield an error. 

## Converting file types
Simply type `magick` followed by an input file and an output file (with different file extension). For example: 

```magick file1.png file2.jpg```

## Creating GIFs

Magick can convert a sequence of images given in a PDF to an output GIF
```magick -density n1 -dispose n2 -delay t images.pdf out.gif```
* n1 controls the pixel density of the image (dpi) and 200 should be sufficient
* n2 controls how we dispose of a previous image (1: overlay, 2: clear frame area with background color, 3: clear image prior to frame overlay (usually what I want))
* t is the time (in centiseconds) between each frame

## Composing many images into 1 PDF
To combine N jpeg files into one single pdf type in

```magick file1.jpeg ... fileN.jpef combined_file.pdf```

* Can do something like \*.jpeg instead to combine all files in current directory.

## Extract frames from GIF
If we have a GIF composed of many frames, we can extract each frame and store each individually as a PNG

```magick name.gif -coalesce out_name_%d.png```

# FFMPEG
[FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/about.html) is *able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created.*
It is already installed on OSC and can be used by typing in 

`module load ffmpeg`

Below, are some of the most commmon uses for ffmpeg that I have encountered

## Converting Images to Videos
Given a set of n images indexed in order numerically (e.g. 00.png $\rightarrow$ 09.png), we can create a video with the following code

```ffmpeg -f image2 -pattern_type glob -framerate fr -i './*.png' -s WxH vid_name.avi```

* fr should be replaced with the desired framerate
* W and H should be replaced with a desired width and height (e.g. 1200x900)
* Make sure that the files are ordered sequentially in to ensure the \*.png specification works
