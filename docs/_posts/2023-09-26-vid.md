This page is a resource filled with commands and tools to manipulate and create images and videos

# ImageMagick
[Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/) is a useful tool to convert images/videos between different file types. First, install ImageMagick from the website (and it may be necessary to install this [postscript and pdf interpreter](https://www.ghostscript.com/releases/index.html) as well). After this, typing `magick` in the command prompt should be able

# FFMPEG
[FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/about.html) is *able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created.*
It is already installed on OSC and can be used by typing in 

`module load ffmpeg`

Below, are some of the most commmon uses for ffmpeg that I have encountered

## Converting Images to Videos
Given a set of n images indexed in order numerically (e.g. 00.png $\rightarrow$ 09.png), we can create a video with the following code

```ffmpeg -f image2 -pattern_type glob -framerate *fr* -i '\*.png' -s *W*x*H* *vid_name*.avi```
