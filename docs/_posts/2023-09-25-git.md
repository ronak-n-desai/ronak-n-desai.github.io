This is a page with all the information I've compiled about using git commands, GitHub Desktop, and related topics. 

# Git commands

## Cloning
To Clone a repository, go to the github repository website and click the green button called `<> Code`. Click the `SSH` tab and note the command that should look like `git@github.com:username/reponame.git`. Next, type 

`git clone git@github.com:username/reponame.git`

in a command line while you're in the folder in which you want to create the repository.

## Branches

## Pull and Push

git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git remote add origin remote_repository_url (where you obtain the url from copy to clickboard under code category of already created repository)
git push -u origin master
