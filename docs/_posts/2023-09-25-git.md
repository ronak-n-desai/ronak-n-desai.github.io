This is a page with all the information I've compiled about using git commands, GitHub Desktop, and related topics. 

# Git commands

## Environments 

To create an environment type: `conda env create --name envname`. Can check the list of environments using `conda env list`.

To activate an environment, use `conda activate envname` and to deactivate type `conda deactivate`

Can remove an unused environment using `conda env remove --name envname`. This doesn't delete the environment folder, just removes the contents, so I would delete the environment folder as well (so that if you decide to create an environment with the same name as the one you just deleted, you won't run into any issues). 

## Cloning
To Clone a repository, go to the github repository website and click the green button called `<> Code`. Click the `SSH` tab and note the command that should look like `git@github.com:username/reponame.git`. Next, type 

`git clone git@github.com:username/reponame.git`

in a command line while you're in the folder in which you want to create the repository.

## Branches

## Pull and Push

git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git remote add origin remote_repository_url (where you obtain the url from copy to clickboard under code category of already created repository)
git push -u origin master
