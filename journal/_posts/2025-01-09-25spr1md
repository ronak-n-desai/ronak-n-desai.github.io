## Paper Updates

In november, my first paper got published in Contributions to Plasma Physics! Additionally, I sent in the second synthetic data paper to the New Journal of Physics (which got desk rejected) and then to APL Machine Learning. Nathaniel also submitted the Wright-Patt paper to APL Machine Learning for one of their special issues. I have also updated the Titan Paper with my simulation efforts which I feel are pretty complete at this time. Some new plots can compare teh proton (left) and electron (right) energy spectra


and conversion efficiency
