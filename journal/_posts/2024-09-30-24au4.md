This post covers work from 09/30-10/11. Now that I've done most of the work on the titan simulations, I decided to get back into the synthetic data paper which I've made good progress on. Additionally, I've been helping out with Nathaniel's experimental paper: making some edits and suggestions.

## Synthetic Data 

I produced the main result which is shown below

I constructed a new objective function

$$ 
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$
