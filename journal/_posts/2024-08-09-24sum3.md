## Summary of Work During the Summer

## Guide on OSC Cluster Resources

I've talked briefly about OSC before, but I'll make a more in depth guide here. OSC has three different Clusters in order of increasing compute capability: 

1. Owens
2. Pitzer
3. Ascend 

**Owens** is the oldest cluster and will be discontinued at some point in the near future. In terms of CPU computing, it has 28 cores per node and a compute capability of 6.0. In terms of GPU computing, it has 1 Pascall P100 GPU of 16GB memory per node. 

**Pitzer** has two different types of nodes: *Skylake* (2018) and *Cascade Lake* (2020). These have a compute capability of 7.0 and 2 Volta V100 GPUs per node. *Skylake* has 40 cores per node and 16GB memory per GPU while *Cascade Lake* has 48 cores/node and 32 GB memory per GPU.

**Ascend** is the newest cluster and has 88 CPU cores/node with a compute capability of 8.0. There are 4 Ampere A100 GPUs per node with 80GB memory each.

The cost breakdown can be seen in the following table:
