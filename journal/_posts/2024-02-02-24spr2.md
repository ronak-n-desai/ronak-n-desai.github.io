# Fuchs v1 Optimization

Since last time, Chris told me I should try plotting the banana of points within the minimum value of the objective function. Below, I have a gif showing how the parameter space evolves in time (sorry for bad quality) for the best 5 percent.

I assumed maximum laser intensity and explored how the focal distance and target thickness would need to change for different values of $K$. Below, is another GIF with looking at just the best 1 percent.
