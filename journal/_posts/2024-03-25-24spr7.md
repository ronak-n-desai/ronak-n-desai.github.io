This post covers work from 03/25 - 04/05. I focused on improving the DAQ process at AFRL and also on getting the synthetic data ready for publication.

# Building an Regression on electron data

Even though the data we collected on 03/18 was limited, I wanted to see what we could learn from fitting a polynomial to the data. The first thing I did was to take all the data and plot a heat map and scatter plot of the number of electrons with MP and PP intensity as inputs

Here, there's no clear correlation. I did the same thing, but with the average pixel instead

Here, it's more clear that a higher pre pulse is desirable. One issue is that since our data collection biased higher main pulse and lower prepulse (can be seen in the correlation plots from the previous post), we aren't able to explore the parameter space fully.

Next, I trained a polynomial regression on the data (80 $\%$ of 4649 points). To better understand the relationship between the variables, First, I varied the MP while keeping the PP constant at 3 different chosen values and outputted the model predictions overlayed with corresponding data from our dataset

To me, it appears that the data is really noisy, so its really hard to see a correlation. I did a similar thing, but instead varied the PP while keeping the MP constant to get a similar plot

Ultimately, we need to collect more data to get a better result, the MP and PP data is just oo noisy. The good news is that Nathaniel recently changed the diode timings on 03/25 to make the MP and PP data less noisy. This should help significantly. Additionally, collecting data at 100Hz would give us 5x more data points to work with.
