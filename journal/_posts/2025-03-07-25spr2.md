## Synthetic Data Paper

We received news of the synthetic data paper being rejected on Wednesday (03/05), we are planning on taking some of the reviewer feedback and submitting it to another journal soon within the next few weeks. 

## Some more titan simulation plots 

I created two additional plots. One shows a stackplot of the energy in the simulation 

![energy_stack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/826943c1-7ce5-4ed9-be63-30ceaab8fc2d)

where the dashed line shows the expected energy injected into the simulation from a simulation where the target is not there (and is approximately the expected energy from the gaussian beam). The top row is single pulse and left column is no preplasma. I converted the 2D energy to the 3D energy by multiplying by a factor of $w_0 \sqrt{2/\pi}$ which comes from the ideal gaussian beam formula. Then, I created a plot showing the maximum proton energy over time in the simulation: 

![max_proton_energy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08520415-7979-4fd7-8aec-c4e8871f69db)

This shows the proton energy peaking between 1600-1800fs into the simulation for all 4 cases.

## Thinking about Double Pulse Setup at Wright-Patt

[This discussion](https://github.com/Warwick-Plasma/epoch/discussions/607) on the EPOCH github seems to be a way to add chirp to a pulse, i.e. a time-dependent wavelength which is something that could be done to a femtosecond pulse to increase its pulse length to a picosecond. So, I would just need to figure out what the hypothetical pulse length would be and how much of the wavelength would change throughout the pulse.
