# More info on Ricky's No Laser Simulations
I previously talked about [Ricky's energy conservation simulations without the laser](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/22aut4/), but I'll go into more detail about it here. 

He used `[field_ionization = T]` and `[use_multiphoton = F]` in the *control* block and `[use_collisions = F]` in the *collisions* block. In this way, we keep track of ionization, but since there is no laser to induce multiphoton ionization, we need to turn that ionization mechanism off (or else EPOCH will give an error message).
