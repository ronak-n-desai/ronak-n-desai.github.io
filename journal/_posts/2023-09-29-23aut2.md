# More info on Ricky's No Laser Simulations
I previously talked about [Ricky's energy conservation simulations without the laser](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/22aut4/), but I'll go into more detail about it here. 

He used `field_ionization = T` and `use_multiphoton = F` in the *control* block and `use_collisions = F` in the *collisions* block. In this way, we keep track of ionization, but since there is no laser to induce multiphoton ionization, we need to turn that ionization mechanism off (or else EPOCH will give an error message). 

![heating_data](https://github.com/ronak-n-desai/ronak-n-desai.github.io/assets/98538788/0e58b7bc-2b41-403a-8558-6d0ec5d34783).

In the table above, Ricky showed some of his heating results with collisions on and collisions off and it seems like it doesn't make an appreciable difference. So, we mind as well turn collisions off just so that we can run more simulations (the heating gain is expressed as a percentage increase from the simulation with 257 electron PPC).


# Refamiliarizing myself with EPOCH
I ran some basic EPOCH simulations and made some animations. First, I simulated a laser interacting with a target at 45 degrees and plotted the electric fields in the x and y direction

Then, I plotted the number density of electrons and protons over time
