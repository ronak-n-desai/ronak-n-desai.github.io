This post covers work from 06/01 - 08/09

## Summary of Work During the Summer

1. I did some work on the synthetic data paper and submitted it to Contributions to Plasma Physics. I only made minor changes before submitting it.
2. I helped Jack work through revising the pre-pulse and pump-depletion model in his synthetic data paper. We have things mostly finished at this point, there are just a few things to sort out before we can start working on the paper.
3. At Wright-Patt, the PP angle issue was fixed. Now there is an accurate mapping between the voltage and angles. To alleviate the shots dropping issue, we decided to lower the acquisition rate to 10Hz. This also allows for a larger exposure time to better detect protons. Additionally, I found an error with my program that was merging data on the 2Hz rate of the WP which I've now fixed.
4. Joseph Martin has done some good work on INNs and he's been getting ready to publish his work and I have been trying to help him with editing and suggestions.

## Guide on OSC Cluster Resources

I've talked briefly [about OSC before](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23spr3/), but I'll make a more in depth guide here. OSC has three different Clusters in order of increasing compute capability:  

1. Owens
2. Pitzer
3. Ascend 

**Owens** is the oldest cluster and will be discontinued at some point in the near future. In terms of CPU computing, it has 28 cores per node and a compute capability of 6.0. In terms of GPU computing, it has 1 Pascall P100 GPU of 16GB memory per node. 

**Pitzer** has two different types of nodes: *Skylake* (2018) and *Cascade Lake* (2020). These have a compute capability of 7.0 and 2 Volta V100 GPUs per node. *Skylake* has 40 cores per node and 16GB memory per GPU while *Cascade Lake* has 48 cores/node and 32 GB memory per GPU.

**Ascend** is the newest cluster and has 88 CPU cores/node with a compute capability of 8.0. There are 4 Ampere A100 GPUs per node with 80GB memory each.

The cost breakdown can be seen in the following table:

## Titan Simulations

### Particle Probes

I decided to use the particle probe block in EPOCH. To make sure that I understood how it worked, I did a basic simulation which involved two populations of electron drifting rightward and leftward. Then, I put 4 probes in the simulation that account for both species of electron and both velocities that we can detect (east bound or west bound). Initially, I kept the left moving electrons on the right side of the grid

and the right moving electrons on the left side of the grid

I set up the simulation so that the particles drift with momentum `1e-23` which ends up being 1.098e7 m/s or 10 microns per picosecond. This is enough velocity to drift the whole length of the simulation over the full simulation time of 1 ps. From this exercise, I learned that when specifying velocity/momentum or getting the output of velocity/momentum, EPOCH returns the **individual** particle velocity/momenetum and not the macroparticle velocity/momentum. To obtain the quantities per macroparticle, you would have to multiply by the weight. Anyway, by setting up the simulation this way, I expected to see the rightward moving electron be detected at the 8 micron eastward facing gate at around 600fs and the leftward moving electrons be detected at the 5 micron westward facing gate at around 300fs.

This is exactly what I saw and we can see that the gates won't detect electrons if they are crossing through the opposite orientation (off-diagonal plots).

### Pre-Plasma

I've talked [about the preplasma before](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23aut6/) and I've implemented it in the same way.
