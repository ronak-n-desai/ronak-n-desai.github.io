This post covers work from 09/16-09/27. I worked on finishing up all the titan simulations for the paper and I also started to get back into the synthetic data paper work as well.

## Titan Simulations

### Collisional Ionization

In my simulations, I did not use collisional ionization, because when I did try, the simulations seemed to take too long. [This paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23148-2) talks about the role of collisional ionization in heavy ion acceleration by high intensity laser pulses. They say that the acceleration of gold ions up to 7 MeV/nucleon has been reported up to charge states of Z=69 (Ne-like) in experiments and the new (at the time) collisional ionization model from EPOCH allows for high charge states. They say that the collisional ionization process is the most important reason for increasing charge states well beyond Z=51 and up to Z=77. However, they say that in experiments, dominant charge state decreases with target thickness, while the simulations imply that it should be constant. Since we used a thick target (much thicker than the 0.5 micron and below they explored in this paper), its possible that the collisional ionization module wouldn't give us higher charge states.

Above, they show the dominant charge states of FI + CI (Magenta), FI (Cyan), and Experiment (Green). It looks like field ionization is limited to go up to a certain charge state. They also mention that recombination is a feature not contained in EPOCH, although they say it is usually not believed to be important during or shortly after the laser-target interaction.
