## Seeing the stability of different initial charge states

I used a 25 cells/micron, 20 particles per cell and a reduced density of 10 times the critical density (instead of 59 times), initial temperature of 1eV. I wanted to see if the target was stable assuming an initial charge state of Z=20, 40, or 60. 

For Z = 20,
