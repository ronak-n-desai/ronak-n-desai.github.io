## Seeing the stability of different initial charge states

I used a 25 cells/micron, 20 particles per cell and a reduced density of 10 times the critical density (instead of 59 times), initial temperature of 1eV. I wanted to see if the target was stable assuming an initial charge state of Z=20, 40, or 60. This is for Z = 20 at 250fs after the start of the sim (without a laser):

To me this looks pretty stable. It takes 100fs for the leading edge of the pulse to arrive at the target (confirmed by ricky's calculations of `las_xmin_time_to_origin_from_boundary` and `las_delay` in `const.status`). So I'm checking at 250fs at which time some fraction of the pulse has fully passed through the target. Here is Z=40:

and Z=60

which expandas a bit more even though there's no laser present. One thing I noticed from the input deck is that there is a thin layer of protons, but no electrons to balance it out to make it charge neutral. From talking to Joe and Gregory, they said that PIC codes expect the simulation to be charge neutral at the start, so I should explicitly add the electrons as well to balance out the charge.
