## Simulations

### Seeing the stability of different initial charge states

I used a 25 cells/micron, 20 particles per cell and a reduced density of 10 times the critical density (instead of 59 times), initial temperature of 1eV. I wanted to see if the target was stable assuming an initial charge state of Z=20, 40, or 60. This is for Z = 20 at 250fs after the start of the sim (without a laser):

To me this looks pretty stable. It takes 100fs for the leading edge of the pulse to arrive at the target (confirmed by ricky's calculations of `las_xmin_time_to_origin_from_boundary` and `las_delay` in `const.status`). So I'm checking at 250fs at which time some fraction of the pulse has fully passed through the target. Here is Z=40:

and Z=60

which expandas a bit more even though there's no laser present. One thing I noticed from the input deck is that there is a thin layer of protons, but no electrons to balance it out to make it charge neutral. From talking to Joe and Gregory, they said that PIC codes expect the simulation to be charge neutral at the start, so I should explicitly add the electrons as well to balance out the charge.

### Tracking Ionization Levels

I ran a simulation with 25 cells/micron, 10 particles per cell, but am now using the full density of 59 nc. I started out the simulation 20 times ionized at just 1eV but tracked ionization states from Z = 41 (corresponding to AuZplus1) to Z = 70 (corresponding to AuZplus30). I found that the electrons expanded much quicker:

The protons also expanded very quickly and pretty much left the simulation after 1 picosecond:

The Gold Ions started out at Z=20 initially, but all ionized to Z=41 or higher almost instantaneously.

In fact, the ionizations pretty much skipped directly to Z = 59 and saturated at Z=69. Below is a plot for Z=68

And now, Z = 69,

for Z = 70, there are so few particles, that I cannot even see the particles on the density plot. After doing all this, I just realized I left the boundary conditions as open, so laser energy didn't even go into the simulation The electric fields quickly balloon up to a really high number and the total energy in particles balloons up to an incredibly high number (mostly from AuZplus29):

### Physics Table

I just realized why using the `physics_table_location` flag didn't work for me. [Apparently](https://epochpic.github.io/documentation/input_deck/input_deck_species.html) this feature wasn't implemented until EPOCH 4.19. I am using 4.18 and its too much trouble to switch over, I remember I tried back in December 2023 and for some reason the simulations were taking really long to run. So, for now, I'll just stick to manually defining the ionization energies and limits.

### Turning off ionization

I am going to simplify things by turning off ionization. I am just going to start the target ionized to Z=69 and not hit it with a laser. I want to see if the target remains stable and doesn't blow up in a quick timeframe. I am going to run the simulation for 500fs which is more than enough time for an appreciable fraction of the laser pulse to fully pass through the target. But again, no laser. I think I need to get this under control first, if I have any hope of proceeding with the simulation.
