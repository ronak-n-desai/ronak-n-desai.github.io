This post covers work from 05/06 - 05/17. I worked on DAQ python scripts at AFRL and also contributed towards writing some of the synthetic data papers. Additionally, my R4DS course started. 

# Making Figures for the Synthetic Data Paper

First, I made a figure to better explain the etching length integration range that causes the [asymmetry](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23aut5/) in the fuchs function with prepulse:

Additionally, I highlighted what the dip and asymmetry looks like for various thicknesses and contrast values in this figure:

Finally, I highlighted the two data campaigns.

Campaign 1 (a) involved discretely scanning over focal distance and target thickness while doing a full scan over main pulse intensity from minimum to maximum for each point. Campaign 2 (b) involved doing one a simultaneous loop of both contrast (pre-pulse intensity) and main pulse intensity for each discrete step of target thickness from 0.5 to 5 $\mu$m.

# Changes to `afrl_data`
- Made inclusion of electron data optional with `merge_electrons` boolean variable
- Added `tqdm` loading bar in `move_data.py`
- Made `move_data.py` optional by directly including the file locations on the computer

# May 10th Data

On May 10th, we collected some data where I actually got to implement my optimization script. Here is a figure that shows the relevant features of the DAQ run

As you can see, there is a region where the Espec suddently reset shot number down to 1, while the global shot count didn't jump. This caused a mismatch in the shot numbers by 42925 (around 7 minutes)

We looped the main pulse from 136 to 116, pre pulse from 6 to 0, and focus from 13.025 to 13.135. My optimization script told us that the optimal coordinates were at (131.2, 0.6, 13.11)
