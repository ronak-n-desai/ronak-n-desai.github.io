This post covers work from 05/06 - 05/17. I worked on DAQ python scripts at AFRL and also contributed towards writing some of the synthetic data papers. Additionally, my R4DS course started. 

# Making Figures for the Synthetic Data Paper

First, I made a figure to better explain the etching length integration range that causes the [asymmetry](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23aut5/) in the fuchs function with prepulse:

Additionally, I highlighted what the dip and asymmetry looks like for various thicknesses and contrast values in this figure:

Finally, I highlighted the two data campaigns.

Campaign 1 (a) involved discretely scanning over focal distance and target thickness while doing a full scan over main pulse intensity from minimum to maximum for each point. Campaign 2 (b) involved doing one a simultaneous loop of both contrast (pre-pulse intensity) and main pulse intensity for each discrete step of target thickness from 0.5 to 5 $\mu$m.
