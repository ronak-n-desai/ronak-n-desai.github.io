# Etching Velocity Simulations Continued

[Last time](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23aut5/), I ran some etching velocity simulations but didn't get conclusive results. This time, I ran a simulation with 2.5x bigger grid and I made the boundary conditions periodic in the y direction. 
I also implemented the absorption energy bug fix (`t_profile = sin(pi*time/(80*femto))*(time lt 80*femto)`) that we found a while ago to make absorption of laser energy through the open boundary work as intended. Below, I plot the main result

In red, I've plotted the field energy divided by the total energy in the simulation over time as a percentage (and then took 100 minus that to get the percent reduction). 
By my calculations I've done previously, I've estimated that 50\% of the energy of the pulse should be diminished in 330fs. From this graph, it looks like the energy reduction doesn't really start until around 60

# Adding Pre-plasma to LaserNet Sims
Nathaniel has been running some sims comparing aluminum/gold targets with single or double pulses to compare the TNSA protons. I have downloaded EPOCH 4.18 and at first tried to re-run his simulations, but second, going to try to run simulations with an exponential scale length pre-plasma to see what kind of effect that has.

## Overview of Simulations
The target itself is either made of aluminum or gold and is 15 microns thick with a length of 36 microns. It is angled at 45 degrees (top left to bottom right) and additionally has a thing layer of protons of 0.5 microns on the rear side of the target to enhance the TNSA process. The grid itself is 28x28 microns. The laser has a wavelength of 1.053 microns with a peak energy of 2.474 Joules. The target density is 6.02e22 and 5.9e22 per cm3 for Aluminum and Gold respectively. 

## Modified Pre-plasma Density and Scale Length
We want to impose a pre-plasma that exponentially decays from the front of the target.

\begin{equation}
  n(d) = n_0 \exp(-d/L)
\end{equation}

where $L \sim 1 \mu m$ is some pre-plasma scale length that we choose, $d$ is the distance away from the target (which itself has thickness $\Delta d$), and $n_0$ is the initial density of the target. After expansion, the density $n_0$ will decrease slightly to $n_0^* < n_0$ to account for the exponential tail of plasma in front of the target. If $n_\text{cut} $ is the number density that we're cutting off at, we wish to find the distance $d^* $ that corresponds to this cutoff and the new density plateau $n_0^*$.

We start with the following two equations

<p>
\begin{align}
  n_\text{cut} &= n_0^* \exp(-d^*/L) \\
  n_0 \Delta d &= n_0^* \Delta d + \int_0^{d^*} n_0^* \exp(-x/L) dx
\end{align}
</p>

which define the density cutoff $n_\text{cut}$ and conservation of particle number pre and post expansion. We can solve this simultaneous set of equations to get

\begin{equation}
  n_0^* = \frac{n_0 \Delta d + n_\text{cut} L}{\Delta d + L}
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
  d^* = L \ln(\frac{n_0^*}{n_\text{cut}}) = L \ln \left( \frac{n_0 \Delta d + n_\text{cut} L}{n_\text{cut} (\Delta d + L)} \right)
\end{equation}
