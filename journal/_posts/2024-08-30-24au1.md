## Fixing Titan Sims

From last week, I've figured out that 25 cells / micron is not a fine enough resolution due to the electron energy suddenly jumping in an unphysical way.

This is an example of what happens to the fields at around 300-400 fs we start seeing this dramatic increase in field energy

and electron energy.

I decided to change to 50 cells / micron. And in doing so, the ionization doesn't jump all that quickly to max ionization. 

### Running at 50 cells/micron

I ran a sim for 1 ps and all looked well up to that point. I then continued the sim by restarting at that snapshot, and this is what the energy looks like

Maybe the weird blip at t = 1000fs is due to when I restarted it. But also, it looks likd there was some other numerical instability at t = 1400fs. So maybe, this resolution is still not high enough. I will try again with 100 cells/micron with 20 ppc and also 50 cells/micron with 50 ppc.
