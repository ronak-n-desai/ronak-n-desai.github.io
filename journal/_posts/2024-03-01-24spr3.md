# Fuchs Optimization

Since last time, I created some better "banana" plots to showcase the simple optimization task we are trying to accomplish. The optimization function I am using is: 

\begin{equation}
f = \frac{\lvert KE_\text{MAX} - KE_\text{cutoff} \rvert}{KE_\text{cutoff}} + C / \text{\eta_p} + \text{PENALTY}
\end{equation}

where $C = {4.5e-3, 1.8e-3, 0.8e-3}$ changes based on the cutoff energy $KE_\text{cutoff} = {1, 0.5, 0.25}$ MeV.

Here is what the optimization task looks like on the analytical fuchs data

The gray lines enclose the valid region that doesn't have a penalty added to the objective function. The red line is the locus of points that match the exact energy cutoff. The green region prefers a higher laser to proton energy conversion efficiency.
The blue region approximately equally weights the proton energy conversion efficiency with the criterion of being close to the energy cutoff
