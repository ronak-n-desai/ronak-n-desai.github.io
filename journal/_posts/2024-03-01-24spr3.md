# Fuchs Optimization

## Proton Energy Conversion
Since last time, I created some better "banana" plots to showcase the simple optimization task we are trying to accomplish. The optimization function I am using is: 

\begin{equation}
f = \frac{\lvert KE_\text{MAX} - KE_\text{cutoff} \rvert}{KE_\text{cutoff}} + \frac{C}{\text{\eta_p}} + \text{PENALTY} \label{eq:objective}
\end{equation}

where $C = {4.5 \cdot 10^{-3}, 1.8 \cdot 10^{-3}, 0.8 \cdot 10^{-3}}$ changes based on the cutoff energy $KE_\text{cutoff} = {1, 0.5, 0.25}$ MeV.

Here is what the optimization task looks like on the analytical fuchs data

The gray lines enclose the region that doesn't have a penalty added to the objective function. The red line is the locus of points that match the exact energy cutoff (excluding the second term in eq \ref{eq:objective}). The green region prefers a higher laser to proton energy conversion efficiency (excluding the first term in eq \ref{eq:objective}). The blue region approximately equally weights the proton energy conversion efficiency with the criterion of being close to the energy cutoff (includes all terms with $C$ being the value that makes the first two terms equally important). The blue and green stars shows the optimal points (lowest objective function value) and all the green and blue points are within 5 $\%$ of this cutoff.

Below, is another plot that shows the performance of SVR, GPR, NN trained on 2000 points with 30$\%$ added gaussian noise. I used 100,000 points evaluated on these models to generate these banana plots

As expected, the NN doesn't perform very well. Interestingly, we can see that the SVR and GPR predict lower target thicknesses than it should, this may be in part the log-scaling that makes these models under-predict the energy spectrum parameters.

## Back to Number of Protons
I've redone this optimization problem using $N_p$ instead of $\eta_p$ where $N_p$ is the number of protons. Accordingly, I adjusted $C = {9 \cdot 10^{9}, 5.4 \cdot 10^9, 3.6 \cdot 10^9}$. Additionally, I trained using 20,000 points on the SVR and 20,000 points on the NN. The GPR ran into memory issues, so I only used 4,000 points.

Here, we can see the optimal parameters don't hug the left gray curve quite as much. Here are the results with 30 $\%$ added noise for the ML models

Confusingly, the SVR seems to do worse with more data.
