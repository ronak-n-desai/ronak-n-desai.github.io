# Fuchs Optimization

Since last time, I created some better "banana" plots to showcase the simple optimization task we are trying to accomplish. Here is what the optimization task looks like on the analytical fuchs data

The gray lines enclose the valid region that doesn't have a penalty added to the objective function. The red line is the locus of points that match the exact energy cutoff. The green region prefers a higher laser to proton energy conversion efficiency.
The blue region approximately
