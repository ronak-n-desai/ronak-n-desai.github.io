# AFRL Data

## 05-10 Data Continued
I went ahead and fixed the shot number error from the `05-10` data by checking if more than a specified amount of shots seem to be dropped (I set it as 1024), then we should only add that previous shot number and not $2^{16}$. We can see this fixed in the following plot:

If we zoom in, we can see that this is actually not fully continuous, many shots are being dropped

And in this plot, it looks like we get around 100 shots of data and then 500 shots of dropped data, but that may change throughout the run. I found that in this run, 556 was the maximum number of shots that got dropped in between two shot numbers, so my tolerance of 1024 is fine for now. I could increase it to be safe.

Here is a histogram that shows a count of shots throughout the in 25000 different bins. I've done this because there are approximately 250000 total shots in this run (Mightex shot count) and using 25000 bins, we would expect around 10 counts in each bin. 
Here, we see that this is true, but we we also see all the gaps in the data as well. While doing this experimental run, we did observe turning off the data saving made the shots not drop. Unfortunately, I cannot show that here because that data wasn't saved. 

Here is the summary plot I made last time, without the shot number error:

## PROBIES

Nathaniel told me that we're planning to change out the proton spectrometer and we might get a new one with the [PROBIES](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article/94/2/023507/2869320/A-flexible-proton-beam-imaging-energy-spectrometer) diagnostic (Proton Beam Imaging Energy Spectrometer). Some of the drawbacks of conventional proton diagnostics (e.g. RCFs) include the following:
- RCF Stacks
  + Low Energy Resolution
  + Counts may be missed in between energies
- Alternatively, in a CCD spectrometer like ours, need a small solid angle beam to travel in straight line
  + Only have access to a small portion of the proton beam -- limited counts
PROBIES has been deployed at Omega EP and NIF-ARC.
