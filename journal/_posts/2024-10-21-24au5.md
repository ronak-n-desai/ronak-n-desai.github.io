This post covers work from 10/21-11/01. I did some more of my dissertation, read a lot of papers, and made some minor edits to papers.

## Contributions to Plasma Physics Paper

The paper finally got accepted! It will probably take at least a few weeks for the editors to publish in a journal and I need to do some procedural stuff like signing license/copyright agreements. 

## arXiv Papers

### Collimated gamma-flash emission along target surface 

[This paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.12780v1#bib.bib70) reports on the production of gamma photons from a high-power laser with a solid target. [There is a nice paper](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article/24/12/123115/930590/Near-surface-electron-acceleration-during-intense) which motivates theoretically a significant enhancement in electron energies when the laser pulse is at grazing incidence as $\gamma_{max} = 1 + \frac{4 a_0 \cos(\theta_n)}{1 - \sin(\theta_n)}$. This can be compared to the typical ponderomotive scaling of electrons $\gamma = \sqrt{1 + a_0^2}$ where $\theta_n$ is the angle of incidence (w.r.t the laser axis and not the target). 

They used 3D PIC simulations to see a collimated gamma photon beam along the target surface *without* having to use grazing incidence. They found this mostly at oblique incident (45 degrees). They say that although the use of a larger incident angle results in higher electron energy (motivated by the other paper), the gamma photon beam collimation and conversion efficiency significantly decreases as the angle approaches 60 degrees. This is also for p-polarization and s-polarization and circular polarization results in a much broader distriburtion with lower energies. 

## Titan Sims Plots

Above is a plot that shows the electric field in the normal direction to the target at 500fs for the four simulations (a) single (b) double (c) single with preplasma (d) double with preplasma. The plots in the bottom row show the electric field that is zoomed in (corresponding to the green square in the plots in the top row)
