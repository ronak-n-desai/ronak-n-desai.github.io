# Ejected Electrons

I realized that my previous results on the electrons being ejected from the simulation didn't make any sense. The electric fields from the positive ions should pull the electrons back and it should take a relatively long time for the electrons to leave the simulation.
We can estimate this by computing the RMS velocity of the electrons which is $7.26 \times 10^5\sqrt{T_\text{eV}}$ m/s from our simulation set up. The corners of the target are around 7 $\mu$m away from the edge of the simulation at a minimum.

Taking this into account, we find that the minimum time for an electron to leave the simulation would be 9.66ps at 1eV or 305fs at 1000eV. If we additionally add the protons in to slow the electons down, this time would get much larger.
As a result, we are not losing many electrons on the time-scale of less than 1ps when there is no laser present. The below plot confirms this.

# Using the exec and eval functions

To execute dynamically generated code in python, the `exec` and `eval` functions are very useful. Below would be an example of how one might use the functions

```python
foo1 = 1
foo2 = 2
idx = random.randint(0, 1)
exec('var = foo{}'.format(idx))
var = eval('foo{}'.format(idx))
```

The `exec` function evaluates a whole line of code (including assignment to a variable) and the `eval` function just evaluates an expression and returns an output (which would need to be assigned). 
I have found these functions useful in extracting data from EPOCH due to the way in which the data needs to be extracted, but I have ran into issues using `exec`.
It seems that sometimes, the variable assigned in `exec` is not properly assigned so that when I try to use it later, I get an error. As a result, I think I should just stick to using `eval` from now on.

# Heating Results
I attempted to run many 2D simulations without a laser for a longer time frame (2ps) but these were too long and expensive and I only ran some fraction of the total amount I wanted to run. I wanted to see if I could make any conclusions from the simulations without the laser.

The above plot shows a clear inverse relation to the number of electron PPC as expected. Additionally, we can see that the amount of heating does increase with the initial temperature. In these plots, I am comparing the temperature increase to that of a simulation with a high number of PPC (because all of them have the electron temperature dropping over time). The plot above is from 300-500 or 800fs and the plot below is from 500-1000 or 2000fs. I didn't start at 0fs, because I wanted to give the ions and electrons some time to stabilize after their initialization.

Additionally, we can see that the Arber Formula over-predicts the simulation heating (in Ricky's simulations with the laser, it did the opposite: under-predicting). In my simulations I did last year, I found this had to do with the size of the target: a smaller target heats up less than one that fills up the whole simulation volume. Due to the difference in the no laser vs laser simulations, it seems like it would be difficult to predict the amount of heating with the laser on from data from simulations without a laser.

# E Field Fluctuations

I tried to look into the fluctuations in the electric field and see how that could be related to the temperature.

This picture shows the E-field Fluctuations and Temperature and how they evolve in time. The E-field fluctuations jump up and down and are not very easy to read. A better metric might be a plot of the average fluctuation and average electron temperature normalized to the fluctuation/electron temp at a given initial temperature. Below is that plot

Here, we can see that the electric field fluctuations and electron temperature both go up linearly with the initial temperature of the electrons in the simulations. The average electron temperature is lower than the y=x line because the electrons are losing energy to the ions over time in the simulation.

One problem with measuring the field fluctuations is that the simulation predicts a much higher value than the Hockney formula

\begin{equation}
\langle E^2 \rangle = \frac{k_B T}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \lambda_D^2} \text{Log}(1 + u_{max^2}) \label{eq:e2}
\end{equation}

The Hockney formula gives around $10^8 V^2/m^2$ and the simulation gives around $10^{18} V^2/m^2$ which is many orders of magnitude off.
