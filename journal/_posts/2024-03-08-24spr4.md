# Log-Scaling Correction
As I've mentioned [previously](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/24spr3/), the log-scaling skews the predictions of a ML model. In fact, it always makes the ML model under-predict the true function. 
The log normal distribution (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution) page) is what I am using to add noise to the output energies. The relevant formula is 

\begin{equation}
  \mu = \log(\frac{\mu_X^2}{\sqrt{\mu_X^2 + \sigma_X^2}})
\end{equation}

Here, $\mu_X$ would be the value of the output energy. After log-scaling, the model will ideally learn the output energy to be $\mu$. When we exponentiate the model prediction, we will be left with $\exp(\mu) < \mu_X$. This is the origin of the under-prediction
