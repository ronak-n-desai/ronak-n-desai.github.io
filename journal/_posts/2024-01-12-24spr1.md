SUMMARY

# Adding preplasma to Titan Sims

[Last time](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23aut6/) I introduced the Titan Single and Double pulse simulations with aluminum and gold that Nathaniel had been working on. I modified the density profile of the target on the front side to decay exponentially with a certain scale length.
The back side still contains the same half-micron thickness layer of protons to enhance the TNSA profile. 

Below is a plot of the electron number density profile of the target initially when there is no preplasma

The total number of electrons is 15 \mu m \times 36 \mu m \times 1 m \times 6.02 \times 10^{28} (1/m^3) = 3.25 \times 10^{19}$. This should be conserved for the target with the added preplasma. Below, I have a plot of the 1 micron scale length preplasma computed from the equations of the [last post](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23aut6/).

The density in the main section of the target is now slightly lower to allow for the electrons to expand. I have numerically checked through EPOCH that the total number of electrons stays the same.
