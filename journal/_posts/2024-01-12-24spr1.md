SUMMARY

# Adding preplasma to Titan Sims

[Last time](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23aut6/) I introduced the Titan Single and Double pulse simulations with aluminum and gold that Nathaniel had been working on. I modified the density profile of the target on the front side to decay exponentially with a certain scale length.
The back side still contains the same half-micron thickness layer of protons to enhance the TNSA profile.
