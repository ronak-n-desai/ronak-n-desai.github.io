I ran some simulations adding a preplasma to the gold and aluminum targets. I worked on creating a research project for Ethan. I did some work trying to use scipy optimize with the Fuchs v3 model.

# Adding preplasma to Titan Sims

[Last time](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23aut6/) I introduced the Titan Single and Double pulse simulations with aluminum and gold that Nathaniel had been working on. I modified the density profile of the target on the front side to decay exponentially with a certain scale length.
The back side still contains the same half-micron thickness layer of protons to enhance the TNSA profile. 

Below is a plot of the electron number density profile of the target initially when there is no preplasma

The total number of electrons is $15 \mu m \times 36 \mu m \times 1 m \times 6.02 \times 10^{28} (1/m^3) = 3.25 \times 10^{19}$. This should be conserved for the target with the added preplasma. Below, I have a plot of the 1 micron scale length preplasma computed from the equations of the [last post](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23aut6/).

The density in the main section of the target is now slightly lower to allow for the electrons to expand. I have numerically checked through EPOCH that the total number of electrons stays the same.

# Jack's Optimization Notebooks
Jack worked on doing optimization of the fuchs function using the `minimize` function from scipy.optimize. From his results it seemed like the following is true

1. The optimizer is comparable in performance to just looking at the best point in the dataset.
   - It can interpolate between values not found on the grid
   - Timewise, it takes longer than evaluating 1 million data points with polynomial model (4.8s versus 1.5s)
2. Polynomial model slightly underpredicts actual proton count
3. Actual optimum occurs with thickness 1.15 micron instead of 0.5 micron. This shows polynomial model may be too simple: always defaults to minimum thickness
4. Would be more beneficial when there are large gaps in input parameter space (more input parameters) and with more complex model (like neural network)
5. All models have a negative focal offset: good that it isn't getting stuck in a local optimum with positive focal offset.

# Optimization of Models for Paper 1
I started to work on the optimization stuff for paper 1. Our problem we are trying to solve is this: Given a desired maximum proton energy (cutoff) $E_c$, how can we produce as many protons as possible when near this cutoff? One one hand, we want the max proton energy $E_\text{MAX}$ to be as close as possible to $E_c$. On the other hand, we want a large number of protons $N_p$. In the Fuchs Model, $N_p = E_\text{TOT}/E_\text{AVG}$ and thus having more total energy would increase the number of protons. We can express this relationship in the following way:

\begin{equation}
   f(E_\text{MAX}, E_\text{TOT}, E_\text{AVG}) =  \frac{ \lvert E_c - E_\text{MAX} \rvert}{E_\text{TOT}} + \frac{K}{N_p}
\end{equation}

where $K$ is a constant that controls the weighting we put on the number of protons produced. The first thing I did was to try and optimize the learned models over a range of different values of $K$ to see what the optimal $E_\text{MAX}$ and $N_p$ were as we changed $K$ and this is what I got:

I found that scipy.optimize just looks for local minima, so it may not be entirely reliable to just feed 1 point. As a result, I decided to feed around 10 points. Overall, I found that the optimizers don't really help that much over just using the full dataset. As a result, Chris and I talked about instead using a more limited amount of points: say around 2000-4000 points.
