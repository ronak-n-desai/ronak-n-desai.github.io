This week, I have been working on updates to the synthetic data paper as well as looking through data from Monday 03/11. I just collected data on 03/14 where we ran the looping program for both the target (Nozzle Focus) and the Waveplate (Main Pulse Angle). I also work on getting all the data into one consolidated file anchored by the shot number and time.
