# MATLAB code explanation
I tried looking through the MATLAB code that converts the pixel number to an energy value, but it was very difficult to read and I couldn't make sense of things. Instead, I will just explain the simplified explanation that depends on only a constant B field explained [here](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article/82/3/033506/359441/Design-of-and-data-reduction-from-compact-Thomson). 

The constant B field was 0.13T in that paper. The deflection can be described by the following picture: An positive ion of velocity $v_0$ traveling along the $z$ axis gets deflected upwards (positive x axis) by a magnetic field that points into the page (-y direction) in the region between $z=0$ and $z=z_B$. After the ion leaves this region (i.e. when $z > z_B$), the ion is left to coast in a straight line until it hits the detector at $z = z_o$. This can be visualized in the following picture taken from the paper:

If the cyclotron radius $r_c = \frac{m v_0}{q B}$, then the location at the detector $x$ and the deflection angle $\phi$ can be calculated as 

\begin{equation}
  x = \frac{z_o  - z_B}{\sqrt{(r_c/z_B)^2 - 1}} + r_c (1 - \sqrt{1 - (z_B/r_c)^2})
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
  \phi = \arctan( ((r_c/z_B)^2 - 1)^{-1/2} )
\end{equation}

A picture from [Morrison et al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aaa8d1) shows how the electrons/protons enter the magnetic spectrometer region.

so the above prescription is applicable for the protons. To look at the electrons

# To Do
- Make Simple ML Training Program: MP, PP -> Espec and extract any trends
- Find Mapping between PP and MP Waveplate Angle and Diode Intensity
- Try to match up Target Data with Waveplate and Nucleo Data
- Deal with overflow of shot number in Mightex Data
