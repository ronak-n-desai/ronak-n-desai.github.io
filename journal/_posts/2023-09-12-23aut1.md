# Conference and UCSD Summer School
In June, I went to my first physics conference: LaserNetUS. I got to presenet my [poster](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/images/LaserNet23_Poster.pdf) on the Fuchs ML work I have been doing. I got to see some important people in the field including Blagoje Djordevic and Scott Wilks and even got to meet Brendan Loughran from the [bayesian optimization paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/high-power-laser-science-and-engineering/article/automated-control-and-optimization-of-laserdriven-ion-acceleration/067E7D12CC7461E51E51B426BC7BDC40). 

On another note, the conference room was *FREEZING* and I was shivering the whole time. I thought it was really cool how they signaled people to walk back inside
