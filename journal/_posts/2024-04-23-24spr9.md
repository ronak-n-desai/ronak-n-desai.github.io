This post covers work from 04/22 - 05/03. I spent most of the time working on stuff related to the DAQ work at AFRL.

| DAQ Run | Start | End | Notes |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |
| 1 | 10:46AM | 11:26AM | Full Looping |
| 2 | 11:44AM | 12:29PM | Not as good as DAQ1 |
| 3 | 1:46PM | 2:29PM | Only looped PP |
