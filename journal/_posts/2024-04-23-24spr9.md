This post covers work from 04/22 - 05/03. I spent most of the time working on stuff related to the DAQ work at AFRL. 

## Other Things

- I revised the code to allow loading dataframes from an already created hdf5 file
- I updated the scripts and `DataManager` class to more easily flow and load/train data.
- I added a `locations` flag to the `load_data` function where we can specify loading data directly from the different directories in the lab, rather than having to move data first

# Things to Do
- Add in Neural Net functionality to `DataManager`
- Think more about how this MP and PP angle issue can be solved
- Work on second synthetic data paper
