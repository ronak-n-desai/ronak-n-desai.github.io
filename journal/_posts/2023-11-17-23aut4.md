# Fuchs Paper Redux

After the rejection from HPLSE, I decided to rework the paper, improving on a few things. First, I properly split the two datasets into a training and testing set. I varied the number of training points from 200 to 5000 points.
Within the training set, I performed 5-fold CV while performing Randomized Searches and Grid Searches to find the optimal hyperparameters for all the regression algorithms (SVR, GPR, Polynomial Ridge Regression). For the Neural Network, I set aside 20 percent of the training data as a validation set and stopped training when the validation loss stopped decreasing.
All algorithms were able to run on CPU, but I also ran on GPU as well to compare run-time performance (except the polynomial regression which has an almost instantaneous run-time on CPU which I didn't run on GPU because RAPIDS does not support multi-output polynomial regression).
I included Grid-Search `.pkl` files for the grid-search results. However, after getting back from Taiwan, Chris said that we should also modify the fuchs model so that it is asymmetric with respect to focal distance to more closely reflect the experiment. 

# Fuchs V4.1 Modification
To account for the peaks in the max proton energy not being symmetric with respect to focal distance, Chris sent us a paper by [Decker](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article/3/5/2047/775476/The-evolution-of-ultra-intense-short-pulse-lasers) which described some physics of short-pulse lasers traveling in underdense plasmas. Jack's model already accounts for an exponential pre-plasma created by a pre-pulse heating the target and causing it to expand. More details can be found [here](https://felice27.github.io/newprepulse/).

We start with the expanded target that has a maximum number density $n_\text{max}$ with an exponentially decaying in distance $x$ profile dependent on a scale length $c_s t_0$. Here, $c_s$ is the speed of sound at the pre-plasma temperature and $t_0$ is the delay time between the pre-pulse and main pulse in which the target has time to expand. We can write this as 

\begin{equation}
n(x) = n_\text{max} \exp(-x/(c_s t_0))
\end{equation}

We assume the target is initially overdense, but as it expands, it develops a point on its decaying tail that transitions from overdense to underdense at the critical density $n_c$ at a position $x_0$ defined by $n_\text{crit} = n_\text{max} \exp(-x_0/(c_s t_0))$ which leads to

\begin{equation}
  x_0 = c_s t_0 ( \ln(n_\text{max}) - \ln(n_\text{crit}) )
\end{equation}
