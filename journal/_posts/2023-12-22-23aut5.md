In December, I worked on using a LWFA paper's results on propagation of lasers in underdense plasmas to help explain the asymmetry in the maximum proton energy spectrum with respect to negative and positive focal distance. I also sent in an application for student support for the NIF conference in Jan/Feb 2024. Additionally, I began working on 2D sims to try to confirm if the math behind this asymmetry makes sense. 

# Explanation of Max Proton Energy Spectrum
[Last Time](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23aut4/), I worked 
on trying to add a way to account for the asymmetry seen in the maximum proton energy spectra seen in 
[Loughran et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/high-power-laser-science-and-engineering/article/automated-control-and-optimization-of-laserdriven-ion-acceleration/067E7D12CC7461E51E51B426BC7BDC40) 
and [Morrison et al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aaa8d1).

Both of these paper show that the highest electron energies are produced when the target is at the peak focus of the laser, but there is some suppression of the proton energy spectra at peak focus. Loughran et. al. gives the following explanation:
> strong suppression of proton flux at the highest intensity may indicate that the acceleration process is further compromised at the highest laser intensities by the contrast levels of our laser, with the prepulses and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) causing adverse pre-heating of the target.

Morrison et. al. also has an explanation
> If the pre-pulse perturbs the back surface of the target, the TNSA process will be stiled. Higher pre-plasma conditions that shut down the TNSA process also would contribute to more energetic electron acceleration. ... lower peak proton energy ... can be attributed to the pre-pulse at least partially punching through the target. 

I have been told that pulse contrast improvements have been made to the laser at WPAFB, which should mitigate this dip in the maximum proton energy at peak focus $z=0$.

Additionally, there appears to be some asymmetry between negative (target is in front of the peak focus) focal length and positive (target is behind the peak focus) focal length $z$. In Loughran et. al. the peaks are almost equal, with just a small increase in max proton energy at negative $z$. This is a less understood effect and at least is not explained in these two aformentioned papers.
