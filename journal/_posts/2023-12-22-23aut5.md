# Adding Asymmetry in Max Proton Energy Spectrum
[Last Time](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23aut4/), I worked 
on trying to add a way to account for the asymmetry seen in the maximum proton energy spectra seen in 
[Loughran et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/high-power-laser-science-and-engineering/article/automated-control-and-optimization-of-laserdriven-ion-acceleration/067E7D12CC7461E51E51B426BC7BDC40) 
and [Morrison et al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aaa8d1).
