# Adding Asymmetry in Max Proton Energy Spectrum
[Last Time](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/23aut4/), I worked 
on trying to add a way to account for the asymmetry seen in the maximum proton energy spectra seen in 
[Loughran et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/high-power-laser-science-and-engineering/article/automated-control-and-optimization-of-laserdriven-ion-acceleration/067E7D12CC7461E51E51B426BC7BDC40) 
and [Morrison et al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aaa8d1).

Both of these paper show that the highest electron energies are produced when the target is at the peak focus of the laser, but there is some suppression of the proton energy spectra at peak focus. Loughran et. al. gives the following explanation:
> strong suppression of proton flux at the highest intensity may indicate that the acceleration process is further compromised at the highest laser intensities by the contrast levels of our laser, with the prepulses and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) causing adverse pre-heating of the target.


Additionally, there appears to be some asymmetry between negative (target is in front of the peak focus) focal length and positive (target is behind the peak focus) focal length $z$. In Loughran et. al. the peaks are almost equal, with just a small increase in max proton energy at negative $z$.
