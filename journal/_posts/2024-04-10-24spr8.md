This post covers work from 04/09 to 04/19. I worked with Nathaniel to try to close the loop by implementing a basic optimization script that can send commands back to the EPICS server. Additionally, we submitted the synthetic data paper to ar$\chi$iv and Journal of Plasma Physics as well.

# Updated Oprimization Script
Changes: 
- Placement of constants in  `constants.py` so that the script doesn't need to be directly edited
- Incorporated Waveplate information by fitting linear regression to $\cos(\theta - \theta_0)^2$ to establish proper mapping of diode to waveplate data
- Added flags for `MANUAL_MODE` so that we can control whether the opimization runs automatically or manually.

## 04/11 Analysis
I collected data with Nathaniel today, but there are some issues with the data.

(1) The Pspec Data didn't get saved, even though the data server was running. 

(2) The
